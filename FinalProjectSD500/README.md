# SD500-Final-Project-PetFinder-API
The project repository should be "Accepted/Forked" by team leaders only. One team member (team leader) will add their team members as "collaborators" so they could collaborate and push their daily progress.
  
Create an application to browse the [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/).

## Workflow
* Bootstrap:
   * get an `access_token` from Petfinder API, decode, and save it with expiration date in local storage.
   * If `access_token` state exists and it is not expired, load it from hard drive, you don't need to get a new one unless it is expired.
* Search for pets: prompt the user asking a few questions about the  `type`pet `name`,, and `gender`, and send a request to the API to retrieve the results.
* Display the results (pet names) in the form of another [select/choice](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts?tab=readme-ov-file#selectmessage-choices-initial-hint-warn) question which allows the user to pick one pet from the results to see more details about the pet.
* When the user picks one pet from the list of results, send a request to the API and display the pet details.
* Redirect the user to the Search prompt.
* Before every request: if `access_token` is not expired attach it to the request headers, otherwise, get a new one, decode it, save it with `exp` date to the local storage, and use the new one.

## Technical Details
Head to the [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/) website and create a free account. Go to `Developer Settings` and retrieve your `API Key` and `Secret Key`. 
  
When your application bootstrap, send a `POST` request to `https://api.petfinder.com/v2/oauth2/token` and include the following JSON in the request body:
```javascript
{
   "grant_type": "client_credentials",
   "client_id": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
   "client_secret": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE"
}
```
The response returns the following body: `{ "token_type": string, "expires_in": number, "access_token": string }`.
* You are allowed to send 50 requests per second, with a total of 1000 requests per day. Keep an eye on your daily usage in the `Developer Settings` page.
* The `access_token` expires in 1 hour.
* You will need to include the `access_token` in all future requests headers as follows: `{ 'Authorization': 'Bearer access_token' }`
* Install the [jwt-decode](https://github.com/auth0/jwt-decode#readme) package (`npm i jwt-decode`). Use the package to decode the `access_token` and read its content.
```typescript
import { jwtDecode } from "jwt-decode";
type JWTType = { exp: number, aud: string, jti: string};

const token = "eyJhsw5c...";
const decoded = jwtDecode<JWTType>(token); // Returns JWTType
```
* The `access_token` contains an `exp` property which is the timestamp of expiration, you may compare it with `Date.now()` to know if the `access_token` has expired or not.
* Install the [node-localstorage](https://github.com/lmaccherone/node-localstorage) package (`npm i node-localstorage` and `npm i @types/node-localstorage`), and persist both `access_token` and `exp` values on the hard-disk, to be retrieved when the application reloads.
* Your application must re-fetch a new `access_token` only if the previous one is expired.
* Install the [prompts](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts#readme) package (`npm i prompts` and `npm i @types/prompts`) and use the [select](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts?tab=readme-ov-file#selectmessage-choices-initial-hint-warn) feature to ask the following list of questions:
    1. Animal `name`, value type is `string` - optional
    2. Animal `type`, value type is `select` from two choices `Dog` or `Cat` - required
    3. Animal `gender`, value type is `select` from the two choices `Male` or `Female` - required
* Once you collect the answers of the above questions, send a request to `GET https://api.petfinder.com/v2/animals` and pass the choices as query string, for example: `?name=Theo&type=Dog&gender=Male`, or `?type=Dog&gender=Male` if the name was null.
* Display the pets `name` as choices for a new [select](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts?tab=readme-ov-file#selectmessage-choices-initial-hint-warn) prompt, where the pet `name` is used as `title` and `id` is used as a `value` for every `choice`. 
* When the user picks a pet, fetch the pet details by `id` from the following API endpoint: `GET https://api.petfinder.com/v2/animals/:id` and display the pet details: `name`, `breed`, `size`, `age`, `color`, `status`. *(replace `:id` in the URL with the pet `id`)*
* Redirect the prompt back to the 3-questions search prompt.
  
## Application specifications
* Use Object-Oriented programming when possible.
* Divide your application into separate modules.
* All responses must be typed, and your application must not have objects with type `any`.
* A daily push is required to track your code progress and measure your performance.
  

## Optional Bonus Requirement (3 extra points)
Integrate a list of bookmarks, as an object of pet `id` and `name` as follows: `{[id: string]: string}`, integrate an additional prompt after the pet details are displayed to:
* add the selected pet from the bookmark list *(if it is not already added)*
* remove the selected pet from the bookmark list *(if it is already added)*
* display the full list of bookmarks
* go to the 3-questions search prompt
  
The bookmark list must also be persisted on the hard-disk and retrieved when the application bootstrap. 
  
## Final Evaluation 
The submission deadline is on Tuesday at 9:00 PM. I will meet with you on Wednesday and Thursday as per the schedule and evaluate the final project code.  

Good luck, and happy coding!
